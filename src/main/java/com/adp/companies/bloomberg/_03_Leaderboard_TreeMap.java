/*
TreeMap keeps scores sorted, allowing efficient descending traversal.

top(K) runs in O(K log S) where S is the number of distinct scores (often smaller than number of players).

addScore and reset maintain the integrity of both maps in O(log S) time.

The intuition behind using TreeMap is that it takes advantage of the fact that scores need to be sorted for the top(K) method.
Although it incurs some cost when adding and resetting scores due to re-sorting,
it is balanced out by the efficient retrieval of the top K scores, which can be expected to be a frequent operation in this context.

Example Scenario
We'll simulate this sequence of method calls:

java
Copy
Edit
Leaderboard.addScore(1, 50);
Leaderboard.addScore(2, 80);
Leaderboard.addScore(3, 50);
Leaderboard.addScore(2, 20);  // Player 2 now has 100
Leaderboard.reset(3);
We'll track both playerScores and sortedScores.

ðŸ“Œ Initial State:
java
Copy
Edit
playerScores = {}
sortedScores = {}
1. addScore(1, 50)
playerScores: {1 â†’ 50}

sortedScores: {50 â†’ 1}

2. addScore(2, 80)
playerScores: {1 â†’ 50, 2 â†’ 80}

sortedScores: {80 â†’ 1, 50 â†’ 1} (TreeMap keeps descending order)

3. addScore(3, 50)
Player 3 also scores 50.

playerScores: {1 â†’ 50, 2 â†’ 80, 3 â†’ 50}

sortedScores: {80 â†’ 1, 50 â†’ 2}

4. addScore(2, 20)
(Player 2's score becomes 80 + 20 = 100)

First, decrease frequency of old score (80 â†’ 0), so remove it.

Then add 100.

java
Copy
Edit
playerScores = {1 â†’ 50, 2 â†’ 100, 3 â†’ 50}
sortedScores = {100 â†’ 1, 50 â†’ 2}
5. reset(3)
Remove player 3 (score 50).

Decrease 50â€™s frequency from 2 â†’ 1.

java
Copy
Edit
playerScores = {1 â†’ 50, 2 â†’ 100}
sortedScores = {100 â†’ 1, 50 â†’ 1}
ðŸ§  Final State Recap
playerScores (Map of player â†’ score):
java
Copy
Edit
{
  1 â†’ 50,
  2 â†’ 100
}
sortedScores (TreeMap of score â†’ number of players with that score):
java
Copy
Edit
{
  100 â†’ 1,
   50 â†’ 1
}
(In descending order thanks to the custom comparator)


Assume sortedScores looks like this:

java
Copy
Edit
{
  100 â†’ 2,
   90 â†’ 1,
   80 â†’ 3
}
That means:

Two players have 100

One player has 90

Three players have 80

Now let's say you call top(3). Here's what happens:

1. First entry: 100 â†’ 2
You need 3 scores; 2 of them are 100.

So: sum += 100 * 2 = 200

Remaining K = 3 - 2 = 1

2. Second entry: 90 â†’ 1
You need 1 more score; one player has 90.

So: sum += 90 * 1 = 90

Now K = 0 â†’ done!

Final Sum: 200 + 90 = 290
ðŸ’¡ Why This Is Efficient
Thanks to the TreeMap being in descending order, the method always starts with the highest scores.

It stops early once it reaches K scores â€” no need to iterate the whole map.

Time complexity is O(K) in the best case, and O(S) in the worst case, where S is the number of distinct scores.
